# Pole-ify Me!

This is an extremely simple (and admittedly, VERY poorly written) website to convert your name into a Polish version of itself :)

#### NOTE: I have hidden links to 5 interesting videos in the website as easter eggs, it is up to you to find out where they are! (Hint: once you find a specific one 3 more become immediately obvious).

#### UPDATE: The website is no longer functional as of 6 February 2025, since I deleted the Gemini API Key that I was using in the public repository to generate responses. To now view the working website, you have to clone the repo on to your local machine, set up the development environment, change the <ENTER_API_KEY_HERE> in `src/fetchResult.js` to your Gemini API Key, and type in `npm run dev` in your terminal. You can, of course, check the UI out using the link provided.
